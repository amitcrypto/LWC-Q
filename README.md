## Grover's algorithm for lightweight block cipher key search

The grover-blocks project contains implementations of Grover oracles for exhaustive key search on lightweight block ciphers via Grover's quantum search algorithm. Version 1.0 provides oracles for GIFT, SKINNY and SATURNIN in the quantum-focused programming language Q# and depends on the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit. The code can be used to obtain quantum resource estimates for exhaustive key search to inform the post-quantum security assessment of GIFT, SKINNY and SATURNIN.

### Installation instructions
- GIFT 
- SKINNY 
- SATURNIN
